			My name is <strong>Kristian</strong>. I currently work as a <em>technical writer</em> for a fintech company, producing <strong>documentation </strong> related to our products.

			I am taking this class as part of the <strong> Web Application Programming</strong> certificate. My end goal is increase my <em>technical knowledge </em> and skill set. I've dabbled with HTML/CSS in other classes and come across it in my work.

            One of my favorites sites is <a href="https://www.saveur.com/recipes-search/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Saveur</a>. In my spare time, I enjoy cooking up meals, especially with new recipes. Saveur has inventive, easy-to-follow recipes, with inspiring pictures. They have recipes for global cuisines and for every palate.

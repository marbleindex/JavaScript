	<h1> Meetup Report </h1>
	<h2> JAMstack </p>
	<p> The JAMstack philosophy embraces:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>J-JavaScript:</strong> Dynamic functionalities are handled by JavaScript. There is no restriction on which framework or library you must use. </li>
			
			<li><strong>A-APIs:</strong> Server side operations are abstracted into reusable APIs and accessed over HTTPS with JavaScript. These can be third party services or your custom function. </li>
			
			<li><strong>M-Markup:</strong> Websites are served as static HTML files. These can be generated from source files, such as Markdown, using a Static Site Generator </li>

		</ul>

	<p> The objective of the <a href="https://jamstack.org/"> JAMstack
	 	organization </a> and regional chapters is to share knowledge related to the JAMstack philosophy. Speakers <em> share knowledge </em> related to <em>static site generation, the modern web ecosystem, web apps, web hosting, and performance solutions </em>.
